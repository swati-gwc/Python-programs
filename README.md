# Python programs
>This repository is new and under construction. Slowly I will add programs into it.

This is my personal repository where I add notes I want to remember or python programs that I practise. 

### Index / List of Programs
1. [Basic Programs for beginners](https://github.com/swati-gwc/Python-programs/blob/main/Python%20Basic%20Problems.ipynb)
2. [List Comprehensions](https://github.com/swati-gwc/Python-programs/blob/main/ListComprehensions.ipynb)

### Some handy information 

### pip related

1. `pip list` displays a list of installed package names and version numbers.
2. `pip show <package-name>` to display detailed information about a specific package.

### conda related

1. `conda install -c conda-forge <package-name>` : Use this command to install package in anaconda or Jupyter Notebook which does not get installed from simple conda install command.
2. If you want to install a specific package inside a specific conda environment, you can use the following command.
First activate the conda environment and then do:
`$ conda install --name <conda_env_name> -c <channel_name> <package_name>`
3. To see all the environment created in anaconda `conda env list`
4. To switch to another environment (say name is tensor_env)  in anaconda prompt : `conda activate tensor_env`
